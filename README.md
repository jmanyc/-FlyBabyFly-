Sidescrolling Pygame game primarily influenced by Jetpack Joyride and Flappy Bird.

<b>Main concept</b>

  A Squirrel wants to become a flying squirrel, so he takes to the skies in his paper airplane and flies as far as he can. 
  Move the airplane through beams (which change the airplane's color) and obstacles (obstacles of the same color don't affect you).
  Don't crash into the ground (or cieling!).
